<ins>***Fun Facts:***

💡 Do you know generally Indonesian names have neither surnames nor family names?       
  It is also very common to have only one word for the full name ([mononym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononym)). [Sukarno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno) and [Suharto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto) were the two Indonesian presidents with mononym.

💡 Indonesian language is gramatically one of the simpliest languages in the universe:    
        👉🏼 No gender and no differentiate male/female for third person pronouns and [possesive pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive)  
      👉🏼 No singular vs plural    
      👉🏼 No [pronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun)  
      👉🏼 No [conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation)
